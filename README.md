# switch-layers

Switch Layer is a QGIS plugin that mutates the visibility of layers one by one with a slider from a selected Group.

Switch the layers visibility without a hassle if you are comparing multiple temporal images.

### How to install

You can either search and install from QGIS menu `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Search ` or can download the zip from this repository and install from the zip file using the QGIS menu `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Install from ZIP`.

### How it works

Make a group from the layers that you want to compare like a time series. Open/refresh the plugin and select the group name and finally move the slider.
